Systems To Do Notes
-Somehow leveling up, getting exp to unlock abilities
-Some UI to unlock abilities
-Figure out how getting XP works, probably multiple ways, healing forest, reparing, combat, collecting some things like offerings
-Start with offering, Dan wakes up, goes to his shrine ( big angry stone sculpture of him ), sees a lot of offerings. Wonders how long he was sleeping and why so many offerings.
-Offerings give him XP
( Dans home, shrine, will server as haven for creatures, so he is essentially spirot of the forest, wakes up in his shrines, sees a lot offerings, wonders how long he was sleeping )
Intro screen, Elderlight forest has been protected by majestic dragon spirit, guarding it for thousands for year, his wisdom and might has been celebrated through all creatures and smaller spirits in the forest since dawn of time.
It is today, the spirit wakes up after long slumber to restore the troubled forest into its former glory.
( Dan is snoring and just looking some fat guy sleeping, then wakes up )

Gathering resources ( chop wood, mine stone and other minerals, pick flowers etc )
