-Write Doc on systems, go through everything, comment it, document it
-Clean up

-Resource object, timer, collecting, refreshing resource over time. Reaction from tree. Pop up, show how much wood is available, when player hits more, tree gets annoyed, takes longer to refresh. ( Wood, hit tree with frying pan ) Have you ever wondered how do you use frying pan to get wood and stone? Well, it's obvious, it's magical frying pan. Simple.
-Tree just press button for each wood available, wood resource pops, tree shakes
-Stone, meter shows up, starts when player presses button, goes fast and and there is small indicator in the bar. Player has to hit at right time. Ie just one time thing, start on their own and has to hit it right spot in next half second or os. Can do it as many times as he wants. If he does it on first time, gets bouble.


//Area logic (what area it is, load surrounding areas)
//Map (ui, display position)
//Areas loading additively. Setup Home area, left, right area, forward and backward area.
//Setup area map, first index sets y direction ( 0 default where home is, 1, going forward, -1 gobing backwards)
//So 0,1 is first area on the right of home. 0,-4, is fourth area on the left of home. 2,3, is two lanes forward from hom and 3 to the right
//Have UI map, display position

//Setup home, enter home, 3d temp art, logic. Probabaly have some map for home, do room upgrades there? how to build new rooms and upgrades

-Add Zim, just running around.
-Add basic Astar navigation

//AI for characters to move between areas and in the area.


// LATER
//Add animated enemy
//Enemies should not be attacking, but more messing with Dan, running around, scaring Chompy. When chompy is scared he runs away
//Implement Chompy
//Chomp logic, character, can run away
//Zim running around collecting things. when he runs to something like a flower, you can press a button to collect as well, even faster

// NOTES
//Scare meter for Chompy? It's more like you are protecting Chompy, Zim talks about how Chomp realy does not like this. Chompy can sense
//their dark energy as he is more magical creature as well, so it affects him a bit more.
//Dan health? reduced only from survival elements or enemies also?
//Enemies should be obnoxious, running arond Dan, biting him etc or do something else? what enemies do? they don't attack
