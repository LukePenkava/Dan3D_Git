/*

-UI assets
-build up the area more
-remove DWT demo
-Astar

//Area logic (what area it is, load surrounding areas)
//Map (ui, display position)
//Areas loading additively. Setup Home area, left, right area, forward and backward area.
//Setup area map, first index sets y direction ( 0 default where home is, 1, going forward, -1 gobing backwards)
//So 0,1 is first area on the right of home. 0,-4, is fourth area on the left of home. 2,3, is two lanes forward from hom and 3 to the right
//Have UI map, display position

//Setup home, enter home, 3d temp art, logic. Probabaly have some map for home, do room upgrades there? how to build new rooms and upgrades

-Add Zim, just running around.
-Add basic Astar navigation

//AI for characters to move between areas and in the area.


// LATER
-Add animated enemy
-Enemies should not be attacking, but more messing with Dan, running around, scaring Chompy. When chompy is scared he runs away
-Implement Chompy
-Chomp logic, character, can run away
-Zim running around collecting things. when he runs to something like a flower, you can press a button to collect as well, even faster
-Probably show how many pieces of wood are there available, timer etc.
-Resource object timer, refreshing resource over time. Pop up, show how much wood is available, when player hits more, tree gets annoyed, takes longer to refresh. ( Wood, hit tree with frying pan ) Have you ever wondered how do you use frying pan to get wood and stone? Well, it's obvious, it's magical frying pan. Simple.

// NOTES
//Scare meter for Chompy? It's more like you are protecting Chompy, Zim talks about how Chomp realy does not like this. Chompy can sense
//their dark energy as he is more magical creature as well, so it affects him a bit more.
//Dan health? reduced only from survival elements or enemies also?
//Enemies should be obnoxious, running arond Dan, biting him etc or do something else? what enemies do? they don't attack
